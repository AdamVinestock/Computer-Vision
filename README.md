# Computer-Vision
These works implement some of the topics covered in CV Reichman course:
- Image features: edges, corners, interest points such as sift.
- Geometry: Stereo, Structure from motion, Homography, epipolar geometry.
- Motion analysis: Optical flow, change detection, tracking.
- Object recognition: Bag of words.
- Additional tools used: Convolution, projective algebra, SVD, 2D/3D transformations, use of eigen vectors, Gaussians mixtures, RANSAC, evaluation methods.
